XTDB supports the Postgres wire protocol and is therefore compatible with several Postgres tools. However, XTDB is not designed to support drop-in replacement with Postgres and full compatibility with Postgres is not a goal for XTDB.

More specifically, whilst XTDB offers some level of compatibility with Postgres' actual SQL dialect, there are many syntactic and functional capabilities which Postgres offers that are not supported in XTDB, and users should generally always refer to XTDB's [SQL documentation](/reference/main/sql/queries).

The advantage of embracing wire protocol compatibility is that many PostgreSQL clients or drivers are able to connect to XTDB seamlessly and run many useful queries without issue. There will always be exceptions and this page will document them as comprehensively as possible.

## Usage examples

    <TabItem label="Python">
This example uses the [Psycopg 3](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/) database adapter.

```python
import asyncio
import psycopg as pg

DB_PARAMS = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432
}

async def insert_trades(conn, trades):
    query = """
    INSERT INTO trades (_id, name, quantity) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
    """

    async with conn.cursor() as cur:
        for trade in trades:
            trade_values = (trade["_id"], trade["name"], trade["quantity"])
            await cur.execute(query, trade_values)

async def get_trades_over(conn, quantity):
    query = """
    SELECT * FROM trades WHERE quantity > %s
    """
    async with conn.cursor() as cur:
        await cur.execute(query, (quantity,))
        return await cur.fetchall()

async def main():
    trades = [
        {"_id": 1, "name": "Trade1", "quantity": 1001},
        {"_id": 2, "name": "Trade2", "quantity": 15},
        {"_id": 3, "name": "Trade3", "quantity": 200},
    ]

    try:
        async with await pg.AsyncConnection.connect(**DB_PARAMS, autocommit=True) as conn:
            conn.adapters.register_dumper(str, pg.types.string.StrDumperVarchar) # required for now https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/3589
            await insert_trades(conn, trades)
            print("Trades inserted successfully")

            result = await get_trades_over(conn, 100)
            print(result)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"Error occurred: {error}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

This example uses the [`postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres) package.

```javascript
"use strict"

import postgres from 'postgres';

const sql = postgres({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  fetch_types: false, // currently required https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/3607
  // debug: console.log
});

// Mapping for all needed JavaScript types to Postgres OIDs - a simpler strategy will be provided soon https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/3606
const typeToOid = {
  number: 23,  // Postgres OID for 'int4'
  string: 25   // Postgres OID for 'text
};
// All other types will be coerced to strings
// Note that this includes int8 (OID 20) due to JavaScript's 53-bit numeric precision
// For the full list of OIDs see "Supported types" for the Postgres Driver at https://docs.xtdb.com

function objsToTypedObjs(objs) {
  return objs.map(o => {
    const transformedEntry = {};
    for (const key in o) {
      if (o.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        const jsType = typeof o[key];
        const oid = typeToOid[jsType];
        if (oid) {
          transformedEntry[key] = sql.typed(o[key], oid);
        } else {
          throw new Error(`Unsupported JS type: ${jsType} for key: ${key}`);
        }
      }
    }
    return transformedEntry;
  });
}

async function insertTrades(trades) {
  if (!Array.isArray(trades) || trades.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Trades must be a non-empty array');
  }

  return await sql`
    INSERT INTO trades
    ${ sql(objsToTypedObjs(trades)) }

async function getTradesOver(quantity) {

async function main() {
  const trades = [

## Recommended third party tools

The following list of third party tools includes drivers, clients or utility CLIs/GUIs that our team has tested. Picking an item from it will help us to ensure that your code will work reliably with XTDB.

We recognize that our community might value some features more than others and we encourage you to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/new) if you think we are missing something important for your language or workflow.

### CLIs

1. [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)

### GUIs

1. VSCode's [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) extension

### Libraries / Programmatic clients

1. [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/) - explicit parameter typing is required for now due to how the library is designed (by default it places the burden of calculating all type information onto the database)

2. [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/)

### Drivers

1. [JDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)

## Compatibility

### Supported types

The definitive list of types and Postgres OIDs supported are available alongside other information in the `pg_catalog` metadata schema:

<Fiddle autoLoad>
  <Query q="SELECT typname, oid FROM pg_catalog.pg_type ORDER BY typname;" />
</Fiddle>

### Main caveats

1. You can use `BEGIN READ WRITE` and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` to execute multiple statements in a single atomic transaction, however transaction are fundamentally non-interactive (see [How XTDB works](/intro/data-model) for details) and this means you can't query in the middle of a transaction. All reads back to the client must happen outside of transactions.
2. JSON-ification of results - generic Postgres drivers can't comprehensively handle the 'polymorphic' and nested types that XTDB supports internally, so many complex structures will be return using JSON columns. Given the lack of [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) functionality present in XTDB currently (we're [working on it](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/3411)), it is therefore important that you control the data you insert into a given column if you want to avoid a monomorphic (simple) type being unexpectedly later returned as a JSON string because the type definition was inadvertently widened by an errant INSERT for an unrelated row. For example, if you INSERT row X with a number for column `foo` and then query it back you will see that same number, however if you then INSERT row Y with a string for column `foo` now row X will now always return column `foo` as string (i.e. it's now JSON). This widening behaviour cannot be undone using the supported XTDB APIs. Please get in touch if you run into difficulties: <a href="mailto:hello@xtdb.com">hello@xtdb.com</a>
3. Lack of `SHOW` and SQL 'window functions' precludes various tools from working.
4. Transactions do not [yet](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/3463) return the information that is needed to correlate clients, so it is recommended to only issue write transactions from a single client for the time being (or use the HTTP API).
5. Certain classes of error messages may be opaque to the client - it may therefore be best to debug queries using the HTTP API during the development workflow for now.
6. `pg_catalog` is partially implemented but is only intended for interoperability with specific supported tools, please use the SQL standard `information_schema` instead
7. Drivers which do not supply proper parameter type information for prepared statements (e.g. [`node-postgres`](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres)) may not be suitable for production usage.

|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user     | ignored_user      | XTDB does not support users currently, but many clients require specifying a user - provide a dummy string  |
| password | ignored_password  | XTDB does not support users currently (or their passwords), but many clients require specifying a password - provide a dummy string |
