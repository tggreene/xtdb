title: Auditing past trade adjustments

import { Query, Txs, Xtplay } from 'xtplay-components'

In [Late trade adjustments](late-trade) we saw the ability to make changes to the previous day's records.

Let's say instead of backfilling a trade to the previous day, someone adds a trade a *month* ago.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO trades (_id, symbol, volume, _valid_from)
            VALUES
            (5, 'GHI', 1000000, DATE '2023-12-01')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, _valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY _id" />
</Xtplay>

Now when the auditors come in, they check for changes since they last were here:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades
            WHERE _valid_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY _id" />
</Xtplay>

They can't find the trade we inserted into last month!

If we want to allow editing the timeline, how can we detect this?

In XTDB we use system-time (a.k.a. wall-clock time), an **immutable** timeline that gets appended to with every change. This means our fraudulent/malicious/accidental edit from earlier gets caught easily:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE _system_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY _id" />
</Xtplay>

In fact we can even scan the system for suspicious or unusual changes. For example, any retroactive changes to valid-time that go back further than 24 hours:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, _system_from, _valid_from
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE (_system_from - _valid_from) > DURATION 'PT24H'
            ORDER BY _id" />
</Xtplay>

Conclusion: As an immutable database, XTDB keeps you safe from your own changes by making sure to record when they happened. Even when reaching into the past!
