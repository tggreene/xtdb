#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-actions-consistency.sh
# Scans .github/workflows for `uses:` references and verifies that each action
# (grouped by owner/repo, ignoring any subpath) is pinned to a single, consistent
# version/ref across all workflows. Reports any mismatches.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bin/check-actions-consistency.sh [--strict]
#
# Options:
#   --strict   Exit with non-zero status if inconsistencies are found.
#
# Notes:
# - Local actions (paths like ./.github/actions/...) and reusable workflows (./.github/workflows/*.yml)
#   are ignored.
# - For actions with subpaths (e.g., gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4), we normalize the key to
#   the base repository (gradle/actions) for consistency.
# - This script only compares the literal ref (e.g., v4 or a SHA). It does not resolve tags.
