== POST /system/finish-block

This endpoint allows clients to manually trigger a block boundary in the transaction log by sending a `finish-block` message. This is especially useful in operational contexts such as after significant batch jobs, data imports, or migrations.

When called, the endpoint sends a `finish-block` message to the transaction log.

The endpoint is exposed via the `healthz` service on the configured HTTP port (typically `8080`):
