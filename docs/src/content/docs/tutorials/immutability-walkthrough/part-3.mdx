In [part 2](/tutorials/immutability-walkthrough/part-2), we queried the historical timeline, to understand what changes were made.

In this part, we will understand how to insert historical data into XTDB.

How does this work with an immutable database!? Let's find out together.

Let's pretend the day today is `2024-01-01`, and we insert a product:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (_id, name, price)
            VALUES
            (1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 340)" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Xtplay>

Let's query the day after this insert:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-02'" />
</Xtplay>

Now, let's query against the past, in **2023**

We should NOT see any data, because the product was inserted into the database on `2024-01-01`:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-01-01'" />
</Xtplay>

## Inserting historical data

But let's say, we want to insert some historical data into our database, all the way back in **2022**.

This could be an import of historical product prices from another system into our XTDB golden store.

We achieve this in XT by setting the `_valid_from` and `_valid_to` column

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (_id, name, price, _valid_from, _valid_to)
            VALUES
            (1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 300, DATE '2022-01-01', DATE '2024-01-01')" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Xtplay>

Now if we query in **2024**, we still get the **2024** value

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-02'" />
</Xtplay>

But if we query in **2023**, we should see the older **2022** value:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-01-01'" />
</Xtplay>

If we query in **2020**, we should see nothing:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2020-01-01'" />
</Xtplay>

## Conclusion

We've shown that it's possible to insert records into the past.

What about if we want to update historical data? How does this work with
an immutable database?
