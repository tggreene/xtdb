import { Query, Txs, Xtplay } from 'xtplay-components'

In [part 1](/tutorials/immutability-walkthrough/part-1), we covered deleted data, and the fact that in an immutable database, data is never truly gone.

In this part, we'll expand more
on the idea of querying the timeline.

Let's use a single record for this example.

Let's pretend the first version is inserted on `2024-01-01`.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (_id, name, price)
            VALUES
            (1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 340)" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Xtplay>

(Notice how we don't have to create a database table explicitly, or tell our database about the columns - the database will learn the schema from the data we give it)

Let's query this product:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Xtplay>

A month later on `2024-02-01`, we decide to update the price of the product.


<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-02-01"
       txs="UPDATE product
            SET price = 360
            WHERE name = 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Xtplay>

Let's check the new price:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Xtplay>

A month later on `2024-03-01`, with part costs still increasing, we increase the price again.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-03-01"
       txs="UPDATE product
            SET price = 400
            WHERE name = 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Xtplay>

Let's say we need to do an audit query, and we need to know
the price of every product as of `2024-01-15`.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-15'" />
</Xtplay>

Here you can see we have the correct historical price for `2024-01-15`, which is 340

Now let's say our CFO wants to know how the prices have increased over Q1?

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT p.*, _valid_from, _valid_to
FROM product
  FOR VALID_TIME FROM DATE '2024-01-01' TO DATE '2024-03-31'
  AS p
ORDER BY _valid_from`} />
</Xtplay>

When did the bicycle price first exceed $350 ?

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT p.*, _valid_from, _valid_to
FROM product
  FOR VALID_TIME FROM DATE '2024-01-01' TO DATE '2024-03-31'
  AS p
WHERE price > 350
ORDER BY _valid_from
LIMIT 1`} />
</Xtplay>

Yes, it was the price change of `2024-02-01` where the bicycle's
price exceeded $350.

## Conclusion

We've shown that it's possible to view the past history of records
in our database without creating any special views, audit tables or
workarounds.

Let's move ahead to [part 3](/tutorials/immutability-walkthrough/part-3).
